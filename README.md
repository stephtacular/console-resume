# Terminal Resume
An interactive **terminal-style resume** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project turns a traditional resume into a fun terminal you can explore like a real shell.
Type commands. Read outputs. Enjoy the cat. 🐱

---

## Overview
This project recreates a lightweight command-line interface directly in the browser.  
All resume content is rendered dynamically through JavaScript, allowing users to type commands and explore different sections.

It’s a simple, framework-free demonstration of:
- DOM manipulation  
- UI logic  
- Custom styling  
- Clean code organization

        /\_/\  
       ( o.o )  < meow. I guard this repo.
        > ^ <
